# Code First

In this version I have created single Gumballmachine class taking care of crank, insert coin, eject gumball features. Gumball machine can be configured to handle multiple version by instantiatin it through constructor.

```java
public GumballMachine( int num_gumballs, int cost, Set<Integer> denominationsAccepted )
```
