## CMPE 202 - LAB #10- AspectJ & Feature IDE
### Lab1 vs Lab10
With the help of AspectJ the code has become more cleaner and configuration variability is now more decoupled. We can add and remove configurations easily. In Lab 1 I was configuring the Gumball machine through constructor, doing so there was low coupling and maintaining such code was difficult. 
Now by using AspectJ the core of the gumball machine is not changing, we can plug and play with configurations and if needed we can add more configurations with ease and minimal changes to existing code. Implementing the code this way makes it easy to understand and follows open close principle.
